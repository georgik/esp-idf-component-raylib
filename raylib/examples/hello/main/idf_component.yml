  # BSP - Board Support Package
  # Multiple BSPs for the same target (e.g., ESP-BOX-3 and M5Stack Core S3 both use ESP32-S3)
  # will be loaded based on target. The Kconfig setting (CONFIG_RAYLIB_BOARD_*) determines
  # which BSP is actually used at runtime.
  
  # Board support via raylib_bsp abstraction layer
  # BSPs must also be listed here because override_path doesn't fetch transitive dependencies
  # NOTE: Only ONE BSP can be active at a time to avoid Kconfig conflicts
  
  # ESP32-S3-BOX-3 (comment out for other boards)
  espressif/esp-box-3_noglib:
    version: "*"
  
  # M5Stack Core S3 (uncomment and comment out ESP-BOX-3 above)
  # espressif/m5stack_core_s3_noglib:
  #   version: "*"
